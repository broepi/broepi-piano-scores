broepi-piano-scores
===================

A collection of my self-made piano scores mostly of progressive rock pieces

The scores are made with a special notation programming language named Lilypond. The source code of
each piece is in a .ly file.

A python script "generate_*.py" generates different versions, depending on options you pass to it:
	--chords

* Centurion -- Glass Hammer (album: "Lex Rex")
	progress: piano intro nearly finished
